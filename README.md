## Description

This project was the creation of application that allows a user to track the employees in a company. The application utilizes SQL to create, view, and update databases of departments, roles, and employees and connect them all together so that each employee is connected to a role and a department in which he/she works. The application can not be seen on a static webpage so a walkthrough video has been created to show functionality. (Video Link)
